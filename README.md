# A Bird Information & Search App
This is a web application that enables users to explore and learn about various birds through a user-friendly interface. The app allows users to search for birds by colors, habitats, and names, providing detailed information on each bird's characteristics, diet, and includes multimedia features like sound and video links.

## Features
* Bird Search: Find birds by color, name, and habitat type.
* Detailed Bird Information: Each bird has a dedicated page with information about its characteristics, diet, and natural habitat.
* Multimedia Integration: Links to videos to see birds in action and audio playback for each bird’s call.

The demo highlights the interactive search options, bird detail pages, and multimedia integration for an immersive learning experience.

## Note on Data and Assets
The bird data structure and UI in this project are inspired by the bird protection organization Društvo za zaštitu ptica Srbije and their Android app Ptice na dlanu. However, no copyrighted assets (such as images or sounds) from the app are included in this repository. All images, sounds, and other media assets are replaced with placeholders in this GitHub repository.

## Future Improvements
I plan to enhance this project by:
* Integrating an open-source bird database.
* Allowing users to create personal accounts.
* Enabling users to upload their own bird photos to personalize their experience.
* Adding options for users to like and follow other accounts, creating a community of bird enthusiasts.
